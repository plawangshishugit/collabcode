## 1️⃣ Project Overview

**CollabCode** is a web-based real-time collaborative code editor where multiple users can join a shared session (room) and edit code together.
It simulates **pair programming**, **coding interviews**, and **remote debugging** environments.

### Core Capabilities (Current MVP)

* User authentication
* Room-based collaboration
* Real-time code synchronization
* Low-latency WebSocket communication

---

## 2️⃣ High-Level System Architecture

```
┌──────────────┐
│   Browser    │
│ (Next.js)    │
└──────┬───────┘
       │ WebSocket (Socket.IO)
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Node.js API  │
│ + WS Server  │
└──────┬───────┘
       │ Room-based Broadcast
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Other Users  │
│ (Editors)    │
└──────────────┘
```

### Key Design Principles

* **Stateless backend** (easy to scale later)
* **Room isolation** (each session is independent)
* **Event-driven communication**
* **Incremental complexity** (CRDTs added later)

---

## 3️⃣ Monorepo Structure (Stage 0)

The project uses an **npm workspace-based monorepo**.

```
collabcode/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/        # Next.js frontend
│   └── server/     # Node.js backend
├── packages/       # Shared code (future)
├── README.md
└── package.json
```

### Why Monorepo?

* Shared types and constants (later stages)
* Unified version control
* Clean separation of concerns

---

## 4️⃣ Stage 0 – System Foundation

### Objective

Establish a **stable communication backbone** using WebSockets.

### What Was Implemented

* Express server
* Socket.IO WebSocket server
* Next.js frontend
* Persistent WebSocket connection

### Key Concept

Unlike HTTP, WebSockets maintain a **persistent bi-directional connection**, which is essential for real-time collaboration.

### Workflow

```
Browser loads page
 → WebSocket handshake
 → Connection stays open
 → Ready for real-time events
```

---

## 5️⃣ Stage 1 – Authentication & Room Management

### Objective

Secure the system and introduce **collaboration boundaries**.

---

### 5.1 Authentication Design

* JWT-based authentication
* Token issued on login/register
* Token sent in `Authorization` header
* Middleware validates access

#### Auth Flow

```
User registers/logs in
 → Server issues JWT
 → Client stores token
 → Token sent with protected requests
```

### Why JWT?

* Stateless authentication
* Works for HTTP and WebSockets
* Scales horizontally

---

### 5.2 Room Management Design

A **room** represents an isolated collaboration session.

Each room has:

* `roomId`
* `ownerId`
* `members`

#### Room Lifecycle

```
Authenticated user
 → Creates room
 → Receives roomId
 → Shares room link
 → Other users join
```

### Security Rule

Only authenticated users can:

* Create rooms
* Join rooms

---

### Why Rooms Matter

* Prevents cross-session data leakage
* Enables per-session analytics
* Maps naturally to WebSocket channels

---

## 6️⃣ Stage 2 – Real-Time Code Synchronization (Core MVP)

### Objective

Enable **live code editing** across multiple users.

---

## 6.1 Editor Integration

* Monaco Editor (same as VS Code)
* React-based wrapper
* Controlled component (code stored in state)

---

## 6.2 WebSocket Event Design

### Events Used

| Event Name    | Direction       | Purpose             |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| `room:join`   | Client → Server | Join WebSocket room |
| `code:change` | Client → Server | Send code updates   |
| `code:update` | Server → Client | Broadcast updates   |

---

## 6.3 Real-Time Sync Workflow

```
User types in editor
 → onChange event fires
 → Emit "code:change" with roomId
 → Server receives event
 → Server broadcasts to room
 → Other clients update editor
```

### Key Implementation Detail

```js
socket.to(roomId).emit("code:update", { code });
```

This ensures:

* Sender does NOT receive its own update
* Infinite loops are avoided

---

## 7️⃣ Stage 3 – Real-Time Cursor Tracking & User Presence

### Objective

Enhance collaboration realism by allowing users to:

* See **other users’ cursors** in real time
* Observe **live presence** inside a room
* Experience behavior similar to Google Docs / VS Code Live Share

This stage focuses on **ephemeral collaboration signals**, not persistent data.

---

## 7.1 Cursor Tracking Design

Cursor position is **not application state**.
It is **transient, high-frequency, and non-persistent**.

Therefore:

* Cursor data is **never stored**
* Cursor updates are **broadcast-only**
* Cursor events are **throttled** for performance

---

### Cursor Event Flow

```
User moves cursor
 → Monaco emits cursor event
 → Throttled client event fires
 → Emit "cursor:move" via WebSocket
 → Server broadcasts to room
 → Other clients render remote cursor
```

---

### Cursor Events Used

| Event Name      | Direction       | Purpose                          |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `cursor:move`   | Client → Server | Send cursor position             |
| `cursor:update` | Server → Client | Broadcast remote cursor movement |

---

### Why Throttling Is Required

Cursor movement can generate **dozens of events per second**.

Without throttling:

* Network flooding occurs
* UI becomes jittery
* Backend load spikes

Solution:

* Cursor events are throttled to ~20 updates/sec
* Ensures smooth UX with minimal overhead

---

### Rendering Remote Cursors

Remote cursors are rendered using **Monaco editor decorations**.

Key characteristics:

* Purely visual
* No impact on document content
* Automatically cleaned up on disconnect

---

## 7.2 User Presence Model

Presence is derived implicitly from WebSocket connections.

A user is considered:

* **Present** → when socket joins a room
* **Absent** → when socket disconnects

No database writes are required.

---

### Presence Events

| Event Name    | Purpose                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| `user:joined` | Notify room of new user  |
| `user:left`   | Notify room of departure |

---

### Design Principle

Presence is:

* **Eventually consistent**
* **Session-scoped**
* **Derived, not stored**

This keeps the system:

* Simple
* Scalable
* Fault-tolerant

---

## 8️⃣ Known Limitation After Stage 3 (Important)

At this stage, users may observe the following behavior:

> When multiple users type **simultaneously**, editor contents may diverge.

### Why This Happens

The current implementation uses **state-based synchronization**.

Each update sends the **entire document**:

```
Client A → "Here is my full document"
Client B → "Here is my full document"
```

When edits occur concurrently:

* Last-arriving update overwrites the other
* Clients may temporarily diverge
* Cursor sync still works correctly

This behavior is **expected and correct** for this stage.

---

### Why This Is Not a Bug

This stage intentionally prioritizes:

* Simplicity
* Clear event flow
* Learning boundaries of naive synchronization

The limitation clearly exposes the need for a more advanced approach.

---

## 9️⃣ Transition to Stage 4 – Why CRDTs Are Required

To achieve **true collaborative editing**, the system must:

* Merge concurrent edits deterministically
* Avoid overwriting user input
* Remain correct under network latency
* Support offline or delayed updates

This requires moving from:

```
State-based sync ❌
```

to:

```
Operation-based sync ✅
```

---

### Solution: CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types)

In Stage 4, the system will integrate **CRDTs (via Yjs)**.

Key advantages:

* No central locking
* Automatic conflict resolution
* Eventual consistency
* Proven in tools like Google Docs and Figma

---

## 10️⃣ System Evolution Summary

| Stage | Capability Added                        |
| ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0     | WebSocket foundation                    |
| 1     | Authentication + room isolation         |
| 2     | Real-time code synchronization (MVP)    |
| 3     | Cursor tracking + user presence         |
| 4     | CRDT-based conflict-free editing (next) |

---
## Stage 3 (Refactored) – Modular Real-Time Collaboration Architecture

As real-time features increased (code sync, cursor tracking, presence), the room page began accumulating multiple responsibilities.

To maintain:

* readability
* scalability
* ease of future CRDT integration

the room editor was **refactored into composable hooks**, following modern React and system-design best practices.

---

## Why Modularization Was Necessary

Before refactoring, the room page handled:

* WebSocket connection lifecycle
* Room join logic
* Code synchronization
* Cursor tracking
* Monaco editor lifecycle

This violated the **Single Responsibility Principle** and made future extensions risky.

---

## Refactored Frontend Structure

```
apps/web/app/room/[roomId]/
├── page.tsx              # UI composition only
├── useRoomSocket.ts      # Socket.IO singleton
├── useCodeSync.ts        # Stage-3 code synchronization
├── useCursorTracking.ts  # Cursor presence & rendering
```

Each module now owns **exactly one responsibility**.

---

## Module Responsibilities

### 1️⃣ `useRoomSocket.ts` – WebSocket Singleton

**Responsibility**

* Create and manage a single Socket.IO connection
* Prevent duplicate socket instances across renders

**Design Principle**

* Shared infrastructure belongs in a singleton
* Business logic should not manage socket lifecycle

---

### 2️⃣ `useCodeSync.ts` – Real-Time Code Synchronization (Stage 3)

**Responsibility**

* Maintain editor code state
* Emit `code:change` events
* Apply `code:update` broadcasts

**Key Insight**
This hook intentionally uses **state-based synchronization**, exposing the limitations of last-write-wins behavior under concurrency.

> This design decision clearly motivates the transition to CRDTs in Stage 4.

---

### 3️⃣ `useCursorTracking.ts` – Cursor Presence

**Responsibility**

* Emit cursor movement events (throttled)
* Render remote cursors using Monaco decorations
* Handle ephemeral presence signals

**Why Separate?**
Cursor presence is:

* high-frequency
* non-persistent
* visually scoped

Separating it avoids coupling UI signals with document state.

---

### 4️⃣ `page.tsx` – Composition Layer

**Responsibility**

* Assemble hooks
* Bind Monaco editor
* Remain free of business logic

The page now acts as a **thin orchestration layer**, improving readability and testability.

---
## Stage 4 – Transition to CRDT-Based Synchronization (Yjs)

### Objective

Stage 3 intentionally used **state-based synchronization**, which exposed classic real-time collaboration problems:

* last-write-wins overwrites
* divergent document states
* lack of true conflict resolution

Stage 4 replaces this with **CRDT-based synchronization** using **Yjs**, enabling mathematically safe concurrent edits.

---

## Why CRDTs Were Necessary

Traditional approaches (emit full text on change) fail under concurrency:

```
User A types "hello"
User B types "world"
→ One update overwrites the other
```

CRDTs solve this by ensuring:

* commutative updates
* eventual consistency
* no central locking
* deterministic convergence

---

## CRDT Architecture Overview

```
Editor (Monaco)
   ↓
Y.Text (CRDT)
   ↓
Encoded Updates (Uint8Array)
   ↓
Network Broadcast
   ↓
Other Clients
```

The **document state is never replaced**, only **merged**.

---

## Stage 5 – Awareness & Presence (Cursors, Users)

### Objective

Enable **real-time presence** without polluting document state.

### Key Concepts

* Awareness data is **ephemeral**
* Presence ≠ document content
* Cursor positions are not persisted

---

### Awareness Design

* Powered by `y-protocols/awareness`
* Each client publishes:

  * user id
  * cursor position
  * color metadata
* Other clients render cursors via Monaco decorations

This separation ensures:

* low bandwidth
* no CRDT pollution
* instant join/leave updates

---

## Stage 6 – Shared Time Travel (Global Undo / Restore)

### Objective

Enable **shared undo / restore** that affects **all participants**, not just one client.

### Design Insight

Local undo is insufficient in collaborative systems.

Instead, the system restores a **previous CRDT snapshot**, ensuring:

* all clients converge
* no partial state rollback
* consistent shared history

---

### Snapshot Strategy

* Snapshots are captured as:

  ```ts
  Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(ydoc)
  ```
* Stored as binary updates
* Restored using:

  ```ts
  Y.applyUpdate(ydoc, snapshot)
  ```

This preserves CRDT guarantees.

---

## Stage 7 – Persistent Version Storage (MongoDB Atlas)

### Objective

Ensure **durability** across:

* page refresh
* reconnects
* server restarts
* new users joining late

---

### Persistence Design

* Snapshots stored as **binary blobs**
* MongoDB Atlas used for:

  * reliability
  * production parity
* Each snapshot is immutable and timestamped

---

### Database Schema

```
RoomSnapshot
├── roomId (indexed)
├── snapshot (Binary)
└── createdAt (Date)
```

---

### Restore-on-Join Flow

```
User joins room
 → Server checks DB
 → Latest snapshot loaded (if exists)
 → CRDT state sent to client
 → Client applies update
```

This guarantees **stateless servers with stateful rooms**.

---

## Stage 8 – Version History Sidebar UI

### Objective

Expose collaborative history to users in a **clear, intuitive UI**.

---

### UX Design

* Sidebar lists:

  * timestamped versions
  * ordered newest → oldest
* Each entry has a **Restore** action
* Restore is **shared**, not local

---

### Separation of Concerns

```
hooks/useSnapshots.ts
  ├─ snapshot capture
  ├─ version metadata
  └─ restore logic

components/VersionHistory.tsx
  └─ presentation only
```

The UI never touches CRDT internals.

---
## Stage 9 – Stable User Identity & Cursor Presence

### Objective

Ensure **consistent collaboration experience** by making users:

* identifiable across refreshes
* visually distinguishable via cursor colors
* stable across sessions (no random identity on reload)

---

### Identity Design

* Identity stored **client-side** using `localStorage`
* Each user has:

  * `id` (UUID)
  * `name`
  * `color`
* Identity is injected into **Yjs Awareness**

This avoids premature backend coupling while remaining production-realistic.

---

### Awareness Data Model

```
awareness.state
├── user
│   ├── id
│   ├── name
│   └── color
└── cursor
    ├── lineNumber
    └── column
```

---

### Cursor Sync Flow

```
User moves cursor
 → Monaco emits cursor event
 → Awareness local state updated
 → Awareness broadcast to peers
 → Remote cursors rendered via Monaco decorations
```

---

### Key Engineering Decisions

* Awareness used for **ephemeral state only**
* CRDT document remains **cursor-free**
* Cursor rendering handled purely at UI layer

This prevents CRDT pollution and keeps state minimal.

---

Excellent — this is **exactly the right moment** to lock the analytics story **before deployment**.
I’ll do two things clearly and cleanly:

1️⃣ **Give you an updated, production-ready Stage 10 documentation section** (README-quality)
2️⃣ **Give you a step-by-step verification checklist** to confirm analytics works **from zero → live UI**

No fluff, no assumptions.

---

# 🧩 Stage 10 – Session Analytics Dashboard

## Objective

Provide **observability** into collaborative coding sessions to enable:

* 📈 performance analysis
* 👥 engagement insights

This stage transforms CollabCode from *“a real-time editor”* into an **observable distributed system**.

---

## Metrics Tracked

| Metric            | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Active Users**  | Live count of connected users per room         |
| **Edits**         | Number of text changes (client-side throttled) |
| **Snapshots**     | Auto version captures (CRDT state saves)       |
| **Restores**      | Shared time-travel / undo operations           |
| **Session Start** | Timestamp of room creation / first join        |

---

## Analytics Architecture

```
Client (EditorClient)
 ├─ emits analytics events
 │   ├─ analytics:edit
 │   ├─ analytics:snapshot
 │   └─ analytics:restore
 ↓
Socket.IO Server
 ├─ per-room in-memory analytics store
 ├─ real-time aggregation
 ↓
Client UI
 └─ live analytics dashboard panel
```

---

## Event Flow (End-to-End)

### 1️⃣ Client emits analytics events

Analytics are emitted **inside existing logic**, not duplicated:

* Edit → emitted from CRDT binding
* Snapshot → emitted when version captured
* Restore → emitted on shared undo

```ts
socket.emit("analytics:edit", {
  roomId,
  userId
});
```

Events are **throttled** to avoid socket flooding.

---

### 2️⃣ Socket server aggregates metrics

Server maintains **per-room analytics state** in memory:

```ts
analyticsStore[roomId] = {
  activeUsers,
  edits,
  snapshots,
  restores,
  sessionStart
};
```

Why in-memory?

* ⚡ ultra-low latency
* 📊 live dashboards

Persistence can be added later without redesign.

---

### 3️⃣ Analytics broadcast to clients

On every update, server emits:

```
analytics:update
```

All connected clients receive **live metrics**.

---

## UI Composition

```
EditorClient
├── Code Editor
├── Version History Sidebar
├── Output Panel
└── Analytics Panel
```

### Design Choice

Each panel:

* subscribes independently
* has no tight coupling
* can be toggled or replaced safely

This follows **modular UI + event-driven state**.

---

## Design Trade-offs

### ✅ What we optimized for

* Real-time feedback
* Minimal latency
* Interview clarity
* Low operational complexity

### ⚠️ What we intentionally deferred

* Long-term analytics persistence
* Historical cross-session reports
* Heavy backend aggregation

These can be added **without breaking the design**.

---

# 🧪 How to Verify Analytics Works (FROM BEGINNING)

Follow this **exact checklist**.

---

## Step 0️⃣ Clean start

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:

```
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:4000
🗄️ MongoDB connected
```

---

## Step 1️⃣ Open two clients

Open **two browsers** (or incognito):

```
http://localhost:3000/room/<same-room-id>
```

---

## Step 2️⃣ Verify active users

**Expected:**

* Analytics panel shows `Active Users = 2`

**Server log should show:**

```
📊 USER JOINED roomId
```

---

## Step 3️⃣ Type in editor

Type continuously for 2–3 seconds.

**Expected:**

* Code syncs in both tabs
* `Edits` count increases gradually (not every keystroke)

**Server log:**

```
📊 EDIT roomId userId
```

---

## Step 4️⃣ Wait for snapshot

Stop typing for ~1 second.

**Expected:**

* `Snapshots` count increments
* Version appears in Version History sidebar

**Server log:**

```
📸 Snapshot saved for room <id>
```

---

## Step 5️⃣ Restore a version

Click any older version.

**Expected:**

* Code rolls back in both clients
* `Restores` metric increments

**Server log:**

```
⏪ Room <id> restored by <userId>
```

---

## Step 6️⃣ Refresh page

Refresh one client.

**Expected:**

* Editor restores latest DB snapshot
* Analytics continue correctly
* No duplication of metrics

---

## Step 7️⃣ Disconnect a client

Close one tab.

**Expected:**

* `Active Users` decrements
* No crash or reset

---
